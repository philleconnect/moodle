# moodle
moodle container for the learning management system

## THIS IS STILL IN ALPHA-STATE

It does run, but there are still problems and it doesn-t integrate in the PhilleConnect LADP yet. So hang on and stay tuned!

## How to use this

After cloning this repository be sure to execute

`git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`

to get the current version of moodle.

To use a certain version (`v3.8.2` is our working version at the moment) go to `moodle/moodle` and execute `git checkout v3.8.2`!
